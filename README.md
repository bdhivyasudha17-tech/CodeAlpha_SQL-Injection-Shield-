# 🩺 MedAI — Pastel-Themed AI Healthcare Chatbot

MedAI is a premium, modern, and responsive AI-powered healthcare assistant chatbot built entirely in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It runs locally in the browser using a zero-dependency retrieval-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine.

Designed with a calming **pastel color palette** (soft mint greens, lavenders, warm peaches, and soft blues), MedAI provides instant responses to common healthcare queries while maintaining safety with built-in emergency keyword detection.
